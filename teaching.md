# Pac-Man Teaching Plan

## Learning Objectives
Students will learn the difference between static and dynamic character behavior. Then, they will implement static behavior using hard coding and dynamic behavior using parameterization. Students will learn about function calls, variables, and if statements.

## Lesson Plan
1. Teach students about functions
    * Move left, right, up, down
1. Demo multiplayer game functionality
1. Game time
1. Teach students about basic if statements
    * Can the ghost move in this direction?
1. Game time
1. Teach students about advanced if statements
    * Is Pac-Man nearby?
1. Game time
1. Teach students about loops
    * Get and keep ghost unstuck
1. Game time
1. Talk about ghost movement logic for original game
    * Artificial intelligence

## Step 1 Sample Code
move(right, 3)

move(down, 2)


## Step 4 Sample Code
if(ghost can move right)

move right

else if(ghost can move left)

move left

## Step 6 Sample Code
If (pac man to the right and can move right)

move right

Else if (pac man to the left and can move left)

Move left

## Step 8 Sample Code
While (not at end of game)

If (pac man to the right and can move right)

move right

Else if (pac man to the left and can move left)

Move left

etc with up and down
