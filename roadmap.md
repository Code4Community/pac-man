# Pac-Man Roadmap

## Goal
This will be a competitive 2-player learning module. Both players will write code to control the ghosts. After they submit their code, they will play as Pac-Man against each other's ghosts.

## Milestones
* Game logic (almost complete)
* Code editor (recently started)
* Multiplayer (not started)

## User Flow
1. Both players start on a splash screen where they can choose to host or join a game.
1. Player 1 clicks host and is assigned a game code.
1. Player 2 clicks join and enters the game code displayed on Player 1's screen.
1. Player 1 writes code to control the ghosts and submits it when ready.
1. Player 2 plays as Pac-Man against the ghosts which move according to Player 1's code.
1. Once the game is over, the players switch and play again (see step 4).
